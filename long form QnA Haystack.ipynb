        "Follow this tutorial to learn how to build and use a pipeline for Long-Form Question Answering (LFQA). LFQA is a variety of the generative question answering task. LFQA systems query large document stores for relevant information and then use this information to generate accurate, multi-sentence answers. In a regular question answering system, the retrieved documents related to the query (context passages) act as source tokens for extracted answers. In an LFQS system, context passages provide the context the system uses to generate original, abstractive, long-form answers."

In the course of explaining the word trance in the poem The Excursion by William Wordsworth, Hastie told his students that if they wanted to know its \"real meaning\", they should go to \"Ramakrishna of Dakshineswar.\" This prompted some of his students, including Narendranath Dutta (later Swami Vivekananda), to visit Ramakrishna.\\nDespite initial reservations, Vivekananda became Ramakrishna\\'s most influential follower, popularizing a modern interpretation of Indian traditions which harmonised Tantra, Yoga and Advaita Vedanta. Vivekananda established the Ramakrishna order, which eventually spread its mission posts throughout the world. Monastic disciples, who renounced their family and became the earliest monks of the Ramakrishna order, included Rakhal Chandra Ghosh (Swami Brahmananda), Kaliprasad Chandra (Swami Abhedananda), Taraknath Ghoshal (Swami Shivananda), Sashibhushan Chakravarty (Swami Ramakrishnananda), Saratchandra Chakravarty (Swami Saradananda), Tulasi Charan Dutta (Swami Nirmalananda), Gangadhar Ghatak (Swami Akhandananda), Hari Prasana (Swami Vijnanananda) Swami Turiyananda and others.', '\\n== Teachings and philosophy ==\\nWhile synthesizing and popularizing various strands of Hindu-thought, most notably classical yoga and (Advaita) Vedanta, Vivekananda was influenced by western ideas such as Universalism, via Unitarian missionaries who collaborated with the Brahmo Samaj. His initial beliefs were shaped by Brahmo concepts, which included belief in a formless God and the deprecation of idolatry, and a \"streamlined, rationalized, monotheistic theology strongly coloured by a selective and modernistic reading of the Upanisads and of the Vedanta\". He propagated the idea that \"the divine, the absolute, exists within all human beings regardless of social status\", and that \"seeing the divine as the essence of others will promote love and social harmony\". Via his affiliations with Keshub Chandra Sen\\'s Nava Vidhan, the Freemasonry lodge, the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj, and Sen\\'s Band of Hope, Vivekananda became acquainted with Western esotericism.He was also influenced by Ramakrishna, who gradually brought Narendra to a Vedanta-based worldview that \"provides the ontological basis for \\'śivajñāne jīver sevā\\', the spiritual practice of serving human beings as actual manifestations of God.\"Vivekananda propagated that the essence of Hinduism was best expressed in Adi Shankara\\'s Advaita Vedanta philosophy. Nevertheless, following Ramakrishna, and in contrast to Advaita Vedanta, Vivekananda believed that the Absolute is both immanent and transcendent. According to Anil Sooklal, Vivekananda\\'s neo-Vedanta \"reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism,\" viewing Brahman as \"one without a second,\" yet \"both qualified, saguna, and qualityless, nirguna.\" Vivekananda summarised the Vedanta as follows, giving it a modern and Universalistic interpretation, showing the influence of classical yoga:\\nEach soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this Divinity within by controlling nature, external and internal. Do this either by work, or worship, or mental discipline, or philosophy—by one, or more, or all of these—and be free. This is the whole of religion. Doctrines, or dogmas, or rituals, or books, or temples, or forms, are but secondary details.\\nVivekananda\\'s emphasis on nirvikalpa samadhi was preceded by medieval yogic influences on Advaita Vedanta. In line with Advaita Vedanta texts like Dŗg-Dŗśya-Viveka (14th century) and Vedantasara (of Sadananda) (15th century), Vivekananda saw samadhi as a means to attain liberation.Vivekananda popularized the notion of involution, a term which Vivekananda probably took from western Theosophists, notably Helena Blavatsky, in addition to Darwin\\'s notion of evolution, and possibly referring to the Samkhya term sātkarya. Theosophic ideas on involution has \"much in common\" with \"theories of the descent of God in Gnosticism, Kabbalah, and other esoteric schools.\" According to Meera Nanda, \"Vivekananda uses the word involution exactly how it appears in Theosophy: the descent, or the involvement, of divine cosnciousness into matter.\" With spirit, Vivekananda refers to prana or purusha, derived (\"with some original twists\") from Samkhya and classical yoga as presented by Patanjali in the Yoga sutras.Vivekananda linked morality with control of the mind, seeing truth, purity and unselfishness as traits which strengthened it. He advised his followers to be holy, unselfish and to have shraddhā (faith). Vivekananda supported brahmacharya, believing it the source of his physical and mental stamina and eloquence.Vivekananda\\'s acquaintance with Western esotericism made him very successful in Western esoteric circles, beginning with his speech in 1893 at the Parliament of Religions. Vivekananda adapted traditional Hindu ideas and religiosity to suit the needs and understandings of his Western audiences, who were especially attracted by and familiar with Western esoteric traditions and movements like Transcendentalism and New thought. An important element in his adaptation of Hindu religiosity was the introduction of his four yoga\\'s model, which includes Raja yoga, his interpretation of Patanjali\\'s Yoga sutras, which offered a practical means to realize the divine force within which is central to modern Western esotericism. In 1896, his book Raja Yoga was published, which became an instant success and was highly influential in the Western understanding of yoga.Nationalism was a prominent theme in Vivekananda\\'s thought. He believed that a country\\'s future depends on its people, and his teachings focused on human development. He wanted \"to set in motion a machinery which will bring noblest ideas to the doorstep of even the poorest and the meanest\".', '\\n=== Transformation into neo-Vedantin ===\\nVivekananda portrayed Ramakrishna as an Advaita Vedantin. Vivekananda\\'s approach can be located in the historical background of Ramakrishna and Calcutta during the mid-19th century. Neevel notes that the image of Ramakrishna underwent several transformations in the writings of his prominent admirers, who changed the \\'religious madman\\' into a calm and well-behaving proponent of Advaita Vedanta. Narasingha Sil has argued that Vivekananda revised and mythologised Ramakrishna\\'s image after Ramakrishna\\'s death. McDaniel notes that the Ramakrishna Mission is biased towards Advaita Vedanta, and downplays the importance of Shaktism in Ramakrishna\\'s spirituality. Malcolm McLean argued that the Ramakrishna Movement presents \"a particular kind of explanation of Ramakrishna, that he was some kind of neo-Vedantist who taught that all religions lead to the same Godhead.\"Carl Olson argued that in his presentation of his master, Vivekananda had hid much of Ramakrishna\\'s embarrassing sexual oddities from the public, because he feared that Ramakrishna would be misunderstood. Tyagananda and Vrajaprana argue that Oslon makes his \"astonishing claim\" based on Kripal\\'s speculations in Kali\\'s Child, which they argue are unsupported by any of the source texts.Sumit Sarkar argued that he found in the Kathamrita traces of a binary opposition between unlearned oral wisdom and learned literate knowledge. He argues that all of our information about Ramakrishna, a rustic near-illiterate Brahmin, comes from urban bhadralok devotees, \"...whose texts simultaneously illuminate and transform.\"Amiya Prosad Sen criticises Neevel\\'s analysis, and writes that \"it is really difficult to separate the Tantrik Ramakrishna from the Vedantic\", since Vedanta and Tantra \"may appear to be different in some respects\", but they also \"share some important postulates between them\".', '\\n== Second visit to the West and final years (1899–1902) ==\\nDespite declining health, Vivekananda left for the West for a second time in June 1899 accompanied by Sister Nivedita and Swami Turiyananda. Following a brief stay in England, he went to the United States. During this visit, Vivekananda established Vedanta Societies in San Francisco and New York and founded a shanti ashrama (peace retreat) in California. He then went to Paris for the Congress of Religions in 1900. His lectures in Paris concerned the worship of the lingam and the authenticity of the Bhagavad Gita. Vivekananda then visited Brittany, Vienna, Istanbul, Athens and Egypt. The French philosopher Jules Bois was his host for most of this period, until he returned to Calcutta on 9 December 1900.After a brief visit to the Advaita Ashrama in Mayavati, Vivekananda settled at Belur Math, where he continued co-ordinating the works of Ramakrishna Mission, the math and the work in England and the US. He had many visitors, including royalty and politicians. Although Vivekananda was unable to attend the Congress of Religions in 1901 in Japan due to deteriorating health, he made pilgrimages to Bodhgaya and Varanasi. Declining health (including asthma, diabetes and chronic insomnia) restricted his activity.', '\\n=== Indian nationalism ===\\nIn the background of emerging nationalism in British-ruled India, Vivekananda crystallised the nationalistic ideal. In the words of social reformer Charles Freer Andrews, \"The Swami\\'s intrepid patriotism gave a new colour to the national movement throughout India. More than any other single individual of that period Vivekananda had made his contribution to the new awakening of India\". Vivekananda drew attention to the extent of poverty in the country, and maintained that addressing such poverty was a prerequisite for national awakening. His nationalistic ideas influenced many Indian thinkers and leaders. Sri Aurobindo regarded Vivekananda as the one who awakened India spiritually. Mahatma Gandhi counted him among the few Hindu reformers \"who have maintained this Hindu religion in a state of splendor by cutting down the dead wood of tradition\".'], 'titles': ['Ramakrishna.txt', 'Swami_Vivekananda.txt', 'Ramakrishna.txt', 'Swami_Vivekananda.txt', 'Swami_Vivekananda.txt']}}>],\n",

According to Anil Sooklal, Vivekananda\\'s neo-Vedanta \"reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism,\" viewing Brahman as \"one without a second,\" yet \"both qualified, saguna, and qualityless, nirguna.\" Vivekananda summarised the Vedanta as follows, giving it a modern and Universalistic interpretation, showing the influence of classical yoga:\\nEach soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this Divinity within by controlling nature, external and internal. Do this either by work, or worship, or mental discipline, or philosophy—by one, or more, or all of these—and be free. This is the whole of religion. Doctrines, or dogmas, or rituals, or books, or temples, or forms, are but secondary details.\\nVivekananda\\'s emphasis on nirvikalpa samadhi was preceded by medieval yogic influences on Advaita Vedanta. In line with Advaita Vedanta texts like Dŗg-Dŗśya-Viveka (14th century) and Vedantasara (of Sadananda) (15th century), Vivekananda saw samadhi as a means to attain liberation.Vivekananda popularized the notion of involution, a term which Vivekananda probably took from western Theosophists, notably Helena Blavatsky, in addition to Darwin\\'s notion of evolution, and possibly referring to the Samkhya term sātkarya. Theosophic ideas on involution has \"much in common\" with \"theories of the descent of God in Gnosticism, Kabbalah, and other esoteric schools.\" According to Meera Nanda, \"Vivekananda uses the word involution exactly how it appears in Theosophy: the descent, or the involvement, of divine cosnciousness into matter.\" With spirit, Vivekananda refers to prana or purusha, derived (\"with some original twists\") from Samkhya and classical yoga as presented by Patanjali in the Yoga sutras.Vivekananda linked morality with control of the mind, seeing truth, purity and unselfishness as traits which strengthened it. He advised his followers to be holy, unselfish and to have shraddhā (faith). Vivekananda supported brahmacharya, believing it the source of his physical and mental stamina and eloquence.Vivekananda\\'s acquaintance with Western esotericism made him very successful in Western esoteric circles, beginning with his speech in 1893 at the Parliament of Religions. Vivekananda adapted traditional Hindu ideas and religiosity to suit the needs and understandings of his Western audiences, who were especially attracted by and familiar with Western esoteric traditions and movements like Transcendentalism and New thought. An important element in his adaptation of Hindu religiosity was the introduction of his four yoga\\'s model, which includes Raja yoga, his interpretation of Patanjali\\'s Yoga sutras, which offered a practical means to realize the divine force within which is central to modern Western esotericism. In 1896, his book Raja Yoga was published, which became an instant success and was highly influential in the Western understanding of yoga.Nationalism was a prominent theme in Vivekananda\\'s thought. He believed that a country\\'s future depends on its people, and his teachings focused on human development. He wanted \"to set in motion a machinery which will bring noblest ideas to the doorstep of even the poorest and the meanest\".', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.5612102090059436, 'meta': {'name': 'Swami_Vivekananda.txt', 'vector_id': '2440'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '88094ab98a156c1790824ac88da9df4c'}>,\n",
              "  <Document: {'content': '\\n=== Transformation into neo-Vedantin ===\\nVivekananda portrayed Ramakrishna as an Advaita Vedantin. Vivekananda\\'s approach can be located in the historical background of Ramakrishna and Calcutta during the mid-19th century. Neevel notes that the image of Ramakrishna underwent several transformations in the writings of his prominent admirers, who changed the \\'religious madman\\' into a calm and well-behaving proponent of Advaita Vedanta. Narasingha Sil has argued that Vivekananda revised and mythologised Ramakrishna\\'s image after Ramakrishna\\'s death. McDaniel notes that the Ramakrishna Mission is biased towards Advaita Vedanta, and downplays the importance of Shaktism in Ramakrishna\\'s spirituality. Malcolm McLean argued that the Ramakrishna Movement presents \"a particular kind of explanation of Ramakrishna, that he was some kind of neo-Vedantist who taught that all religions lead to the same Godhead.\"Carl Olson argued that in his presentation of his master, Vivekananda had hid much of Ramakrishna\\'s embarrassing sexual oddities from the public, because he feared that Ramakrishna would be misunderstood. Tyagananda and Vrajaprana argue that Oslon makes his \"astonishing claim\" based on Kripal\\'s speculations in Kali\\'s Child, which they argue are unsupported by any of the source texts.Sumit Sarkar argued that he found in the Kathamrita traces of a binary opposition between unlearned oral wisdom and learned literate knowledge. He argues that all of our information about Ramakrishna, a rustic near-illiterate Brahmin, comes from urban bhadralok devotees, \"...whose texts simultaneously illuminate and transform.\"Amiya Prosad Sen criticises Neevel\\'s analysis, and writes that \"it is really difficult to separate the Tantrik Ramakrishna from the Vedantic\", since Vedanta and Tantra \"may appear to be different in some respects\", but they also \"share some important postulates between them\".', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.5600596466662053, 'meta': {'name': 'Ramakrishna.txt', 'vector_id': '2417'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '86c2bc5511976fe69f0c29e8ffd3526'}>,\n",

Following a brief stay in England, he went to the United States. During this visit, Vivekananda established Vedanta Societies in San Francisco and New York and founded a shanti ashrama (peace retreat) in California. He then went to Paris for the Congress of Religions in 1900. His lectures in Paris concerned the worship of the lingam and the authenticity of the Bhagavad Gita. Vivekananda then visited Brittany, Vienna, Istanbul, Athens and Egypt. The French philosopher Jules Bois was his host for most of this period, until he returned to Calcutta on 9 December 1900.After a brief visit to the Advaita Ashrama in Mayavati, Vivekananda settled at Belur Math, where he continued co-ordinating the works of Ramakrishna Mission, the math and the work in England and the US. He had many visitors, including royalty and politicians.
